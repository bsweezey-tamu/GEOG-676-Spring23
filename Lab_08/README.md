Brett Sweezey GEOG 676 E-Portfolio: Master Well Dataset
======
There can be discrepancies between the oil well locations which arise from the end user accumulating data from various online databases. The manner in which geographical location is collected and recorded can differ between private inudustries and well as local and federal government organizations. Variation in data may be the result of inaccurate or old data sets and the use of incorect coordinate systems that are projected onto ArcGIS maps.
