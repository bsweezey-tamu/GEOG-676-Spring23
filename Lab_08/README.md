Brett Sweezey GEOG 676 E-Portfolio: Master Well Dataset
======

Industry Problem: There are discrepancies between physical oil well locations which arise from the accumulation of data from various online databases. The manner in which geographical location is collected and recorded can differ between private inudustries and local and federal government organizations. Variation in data may be the result of inaccurate or old data sets and the use of incorect coordinate systems that are projected onto ArcGIS maps. 

Project Proposal and Goal
======
This project will be designed to create a software tool that will combine the location data from various industry oil well databases that may include similar, yet conflicting geographical information. This tool will: 1) Include database information from CAD, Decision Sapce Geographics, Petrel, OpenWells, COMPASS, and state regulatory databases. 2) Calculate the inverses between oil well locations from imported databases and create a new Master Well location database with the most accurate and updated trending position 3) Determine whether the coordinates within each database are in the coordinate systems NAD83 or NAD 27 4) Develop a tool that allows the end user to select the master well location through different aerial images.
